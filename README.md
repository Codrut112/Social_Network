Project with GUI

During a semester-long project, I enhanced my Java proficiency and broadened my skill set. Through hands-on work, I delved into domain-driven design, lambdas, JavaFX GUI development, database integration, file management in Java, and the observer pattern. This experience allowed me to reinforce my Java knowledge while venturing into uncharted territories of the language.

Lets take a look at the application:
